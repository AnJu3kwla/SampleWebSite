      <h2>You Get in Touch</h2>
      <p>You can reach out to use in a number of ways; If you prefer to learn as a part of a group, you can attend an upcoming workshop. If you'd prefer a one-on-one consultation, you can choose someone with similar interests or skills and reach out to them. If you're still not sure what you need, you can attend our open hours.</p>
